# Master-Hwoarang

This moveset mod was created to envision Hwoarang as he a master just like his former master Baek-Doo-San
by allowing him to access a good amount of LFF and RFF moves in LFS and RFS stances respectively.

Which in turn made his safety even higher while making
his pressure even better with the added touch of Baek's style.

This moveset mod was made using @Kiloutre's Tekken Moveset Extractor, without it this idea would simply remain as such.

# DISCLAIMER

This is only a fan-made moveset, made by replicating existing behaviors and animations from TEKKEN 7, game also designed and animated by Bandai Namco and the Tekken Project. Any resemblance or similarity with unannounced or unreleased content for TEKKEN 7 is purely coincidental. The mod has been tested and it's safe to use, but I do not take any responsibility for any harm or damage it may cause to your computer.

# HOW TO USE THIS MOVESET
This moveset mod was designed to be loaded with Tekken Moveset Extractor, being imported into memory in real-time. In order to use this moveset mod, you'll need the following files:

Hwoarang & Baek's animations from Tekken Tag Tournament 2 (Animation Names in the README File of https://github.com/FPISSUM/Master-Hwoarang/releases)

You can get these animations by dumpping or downloading Tekken Tag 2 into the latest version of CEMU. Once your CEMU has been setup and you have a copy of Tekken Tag 2 for the WiiU boot up the game and the extractor. Go to practice mode and select Hwoarang & Baek then extract their movesets. Afterwards you can close the application and go to the extracted chars folder found within the TekkenMoveExtractor Folder. Go through both their folders and go specifically to the anims folder and cross reference with the README from the Master Hwoarang Folder and copy the exact animations required to the Master Hwoarang anims folder. Lastly boot up Tekken 7 with the extractor select Hwoarang in practice mode and extract his moveset. Move the Master Hwoarang folder to the extracter chars folder in the TekkenMoveExtractor Folder. Copy the anims file from T7_Hwo folder to the Master Hwoarang folder and it should be good to go. Import to either player 1 or player 2 side with Hwoarang in game and enjoy playing Master Hwoarang!

Please make sure you've got all the .bin files before loading the mod or otherwise game crashes might happen. Further instructions on how to extract animation files can be found on the Tekken Moveset Extractor Github page here: https://github.com/Kiloutre/TekkenMovesetExtractor.

The moveset works on any character, but it was intended for Hwoarang ONLY. Hitboxes may behave differently on bigger character models, so keep that in mind. Refer to the extraction tool's Github page for more information about how to use it correctly and how to play online with the mod.

# BUGS/ISSUES/PROBLEMS
The variants on this game are so big that it's almost impossible to test the moveset on/against every character on every circumstance and on every stage, so expect some bugs. If you happen to find any unexpected behaviors, please let me know so I can fix them for future updates. You can set up an issue here on Github or report stuff at my Twitter (@FPISSUM). I will check on both from time to time.
