# Master-Hwoarang

This moveset mod was created to envision Hwoarang as he a master just like his former master Baek-Doo-San
by allowing him to access a good amount of LFF and RFF moves in LFS and RFS stances respectively.
Which in turn made his safety even higher while making his pressure even better with the added touch of Baek's style.

This moveset mod was made using @Kiloutre's Tekken Moveset Extractor, without it this idea would simply remain as such. 

# TRAILER

# DISCLAIMER

This is only a fan-made moveset, made by replicating existing behaviors and animations from TEKKEN 7, game also designed and animated by Bandai Namco and the Tekken Project. Any resemblance or similarity with unannounced or unreleased content for TEKKEN 7 is purely coincidental. The mod has been tested and it's safe to use, but I do not take any responsibility for any harm or damage it may cause to your computer.

# HOW TO USE THIS MOVESET
This moveset mod was designed to be loaded with Tekken Moveset Extractor, being imported into memory in real-time. In order to use this moveset mod, you'll need the following files:

Hwoarang & Baek's animations from Tekken Tag Tournament 2
You can find a list of the required animation binaries in the "README.txt" inside this project, please make sure you've got all the .bin files before loading the mod or otherwise game crashes might happen. Further instructions on how to extract animation files can be found on the Tekken Moveset Extractor Github page here: https://github.com/Kiloutre/TekkenMovesetExtractor.

Once you've gathered all the files, simply put them inside "anim" and then move the "MASTER_HWOARANG" folder to "extracted_chars" (located inside the Tekken Moveset Extractor folder). Next, start the game, and once it's fully loaded, open the tool, select the moveset from the list, click "Set Online Local Player" and wait for the moveset to be loaded. Once it's done you can then select any game mode and any character you want and the moveset will be ready at the start of the match. The moveset works on any character, but it was intended for Hwoarang ONLY. Hitboxes may behave differently on bigger character models, so keep that in mind. Refer to the extraction tool's Github page for more information about how to use it correctly and how to play online with the mod.

# BUGS/ISSUES/PROBLEMS
The variants on this game are so big that it's almost impossible to test the moveset on/against every character on every circumstance and on every stage, so expect some bugs. If you happen to find any unexpected behaviors, please let me know so I can fix them for future updates. You can set up an issue here on Github or report stuff at my Twitter (@FPISSUM). I will check on both from time to time.
